				<p>
					Our rehabilitation programs consist of licensed therapists and assistants using a team approach to help each resident achieve their highest functional status. We encourage each person to participate actively in their progressive rehabilitation plan, and offer support, respect and understanding to help seniors achieve the highest quality of life possible. Therapies are available to all residents and on an outpatient basis as well. Extensive rehabilitation therapy services are available seven days a week, and include audiology, occupational, orthopedic, physical and speech therapies.
				</p>
				
				
				<h3>Unique Services</h3>

				<p>
					O'Neil Healthcare and Orthopaedics Associates came together several years ago to form the Orthopaedic Clinic at Bradley Bay Health Center. The center offers physician consultation, evaluation, and post surgical follow-ups within our facility. The center offers treatments and services that are covered by most insurance plans and Medicare.
				</p>

				<h5><strong>Physical Therapy</strong></h5>
				<p>
					Through physical therapy you will maximize your strength, flexibility and balance. Our therapists utilize traditional therapy methods, as well as the most current treatment approaches.
				</p>

				<h5><strong>Occupational Therapy</strong></h5>
				<p>
					Occupational therapy is for those looking to increase their independence in order to manage the activities of daily living.
				</p>

				<h5><strong>Speech Therapy</strong></h5>
				<p>
					Our speech therapists help our residents regain their communication abilities. The therapists are also certified in swallowing rehabilitation, to provide care to those experiencing Dysphagia.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Regain Your Independence</h3>

				<p>
					Rehabilitation is a critical part of recovery for many people that have encountered a hospital stay. After surgery, injury, or illness, the staff at O'Neil Healthcare can provide the physical and emotional support to help you and your loved ones achieve their optimal quality of life. Our rehabilitation team consists of licensed physical, occupational, and speech therapists. Our in-house staff specializes in orthopedic post-hospital care, joint replacement rehab, stroke and neurological rehab and post-medical and -surgical reconditioning. The therapy team works closely with our compassionate nursing staff to ensure excellent medical attention and care is provided.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					At O'Neil Healthcare recovery and rehabilitation are our primary goals. We offer recovering patients an opportunity to maximize their strength, function, mobility, and confidence so that they can regain as much independence as possible. We support short-term admissions and encourage residents to return to their homes as soon as possible.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Residents will be seen and evaluated the same day that they are admitted. Guests receiving short-term rehabilitation enjoy a tastefully appointed room that includes a phone and cable television, both free of charge. Prior to discharge, a home visit will be arranged to assess and promote a restorative environment.
				</p>

				<h3>We Can Help</h3>
				<p>
					Our therapy gym contains state-of-the-art equipment; everything from the Nu-Step recumbent bicycle to a Wii virtual reality gaming system. Our Rehab Department is staffed in-house with Licensed Physical, Occupational, and Speech Therapists and their Assistants. Our compassionate therapy team evaluates rehab candidates and creates an individualized treatment plan for each resident. The goal of our Rehab Department is to assist each person to reach their maximum functional potential and to regain optimal health and independence.
