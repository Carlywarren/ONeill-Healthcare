					O'Neill Healthcare is committed to providing the finest health care services in Northeastern Ohio, and to maintain a sincere, respectful concern for each and every one of our residents. Through our four West Shore facilities - Bay Village, North Ridgeville, Lakewood, North Olmsted and Fairview Park in early Fall 2014 - we provide seniors with the diverse, personal, and quality care they need, from Independent Living, to Alzheimer's care, to outpatient services.
				</p>
				<h3>A Family Tradition</h3>
				<p>
					The John O'Neill Family has owned and managed local facilities since 1962, building a solid reputation in the community for providing excellent, comprehensive care. The outstanding reputation and numerous awards received by the ONM facilities are a result of their commitment to nurturing their clientele and employees to create positive, caring environments.
				</p>
				<h3>Our Mission</h3>
				<p>
					Our mission is to provide the highest quality of life to each resident, utilizing a holistic approach that involves family and community, while encouraging active participation in a progressive rehabilitation plan. All of this takes place in a caring, supportive, and homelike atmosphere.
