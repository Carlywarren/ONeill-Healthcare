				</header>
				<p>Recognized as one of the finest heath care centers in Northeast Ohio, Bradley Bay Health Center believes in providing the highest quality of life to its residents in a caring, supportive, homelike environment. We encourage the involvement of family and community, and active participation in a progressive rehabilitation plan.</p>

				<p>Each resident has the luxury and dignity of a private room in a specialized area of the center, whether it be an assisted living suite, short-term rehabilitation room, private nursing room, Alzheimer's care, hospice care, or a vacation suite for respite care.</p>
				

				<h2>Built on Family Values</h2>
				<p>Since 1962, the O'Neill family has nurtured its residents, while expanding the facility and services to meet the changing needs of families in today's society. Our outstanding reputation and numerous awards are a result of the O'Neill family's commitment to delivering superior senior care.</p>
				

				<blockquote>Residents enjoy the privacy of single or double-occupancy apartments in beautifully appointed settings, designed to meet the needs of older individuals. Each suite is equipped with emergency buttons, and the Center's nursing staff responds immediately when any one of them is pressed. </blockquote>

				<h3>Homelike Environment</h3>
				<p>
					Bradley Bay Health Center's quiet, residential location provides a comforting environment for our residents. The outdoor porches, landscaped walkways and protected courtyards provide residents with safe and relaxing opportunities to enjoy an outdoor stroll or gaze at the beautiful view.
				</p>
				<p>
					Common areas in the center provide seniors with an opportunity to gather comfortably in dining rooms and cozy lounges where they can share meals, enjoy events and participate in many social activities.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Dining</h3>
				
				<p>Dining at Bradley Bay Health Center is like being able to enjoy your favorite restaurant at every meal. Menus are individually tailored and prepared around residents' needs and interests. Home prepared meals, lovingly made and served in a warm and inviting environment, delight the taste buds. And because every dish is personally reviewed by our Dieticians, you can be sure each meal exceeds all acceptable nutritional standards.</p>
				<p>Although residents are encouraged to enjoy their meals in our tastefully decorated dining rooms, they also have the option of eating in their rooms or enjoying the occasional "breakfast in bed." But you're not done having your say. Bradley Bay also has a Food Committee where residents are encouraged to participate and give ongoing feedback on menu satisfaction, as well as recommendations for additional dishes.</p>
				<h3>Activities</h3>
