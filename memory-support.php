				<p>
					We here at the O'Neil Healthcare want all of our patients to be able to experience a satisfying life. Our Memory Support Community can provide just that for your loved ones! The challenges of memory loss can cause frustration for many. At Memory Care, we have carefully planned our community so that frustration melts away and patient enjoyment rises. 

				</p>
				
				
				<h3>A Unique Layout </h3>

				

				
				<p>
					Memory Care engages patients' senses with a unique twenty-foot wide neighborhood. The center is intended to remind patients of what is familiar to them, provide them with activities that they have been doing their entire life. This neighborhood spans the length of the 24-suite community and features four life skill centers which include a retail shop, workshop, laundry, and beauty shop. These interactive centers provide the residents with a sense of identity, accomplishment, and independence. The width of the corridor can be seen within the resident's complete line of sight. This minimizes the anxiety associated with negotiating right angles, which is present in most facilities. Multiple orienting and cuing opportunities help guide patients and encourage their self-sufficiency.
				</p>
				
				

				<h3>More Accommodations</h3>

				<p>
					Memory Care also has other rooms for the patients to enjoy. Two separate dining rooms accommodate individual levels of assistance. Some more features of our calming and particularly successful facility are a covered patio (for rainy days), a way finding courtyard (visible from the community), and resident suites designed to reduce the impediments of incontinence. Our community is filled with soothing colors and materials for an overall relaxing design. 

				</p>
				
				

				<h3>Come for a visit!  </h3>
				<p>
					We are happy to help you and your loved-ones at our Memory Support Community. See our community for yourself by coming out for a visit and learn firsthand what Memory Care can do for your family.
